# Data-Structures-Java
Contains implementations of common data structures in Java. Done as practice for upcoming technical interviews.

As I stand in January, I have three upcoming interviews this month. In the interest of practicing my data structures (and brushing up on my coding skills after winter break), I created this repository to implement each data structure in Java.

(I also created a repository in which I practiced created these data structures in JavaScript: https://github.com/hccallaway/Data-Structures-JS)

## To download
- `cd` into the location where you'd like to store the file
- `git clone https://github.com/hccallaway/Data-Structures-Java.git`
- Now the file will exist in that location.
